# Gully Snacks

I started this project as a super simple, super basic recipe website for the [Gully Squad](https://app.moonclerk.com/pay/3a34scg83o6h). If it finds use and need, I will expand it as necessary. Just figured this was an easy way to test out layout stuff and see if people will actually use it consistently. 

For the time being, it's just a pure HTTP/CSS endeavor running on Apache. No fancy CI/CD stuff, not libraries, none of that. Doing it the old way.
